I am a PhD student at CERMICS under the supervision of Axel Parmentier and Vincent Leclère, and industrial collaboration with RTE.
I am working on predictive maintenance of offshore electrical substations.

Before that, I graduated from Ecole polytechnique (X2019) and got a master’s degree in Operations Research (MPRO/ Master Parisien de Recherche Opérationnelle).

**Research interests:**
Stochastic Optimization, Operations Research, Machine learning
